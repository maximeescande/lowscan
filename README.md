# lowscan
A tiny yet powerful scanner app for any Android device :-)

Why another scanner while so many exist already?

1. Most app are closed-source
2. They don't necessarily allow the user to fine tune parameters (e.g., thresholds, brightness...)
3. They don't perform good (or don't work at all) on black surfaces (like LCD tablets aka e-writers)
4. They take a lot of device storage for the functionality it provides -> Planned obsolescence
5. They don't necessarily exist for older os version of the phone
